### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Tim, a Master student Data Science & Entrepreneurship at the Jheronimus Academy of Data Science ([JADS](https://www.jads.nl/)).  
I have a (not so) secret crush on spreadheets, but Python and R are cool to!  
My professional interests are data quality, algorithmic interpretability, and making data science work for everybody.  
Besides that, if it's about sports, philosophy, or nerdy things, you'll probably find me interested.
